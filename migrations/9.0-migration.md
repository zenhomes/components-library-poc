# Migrating from `v8.x.x`

## Migrating `CustomCounter`

Version `9.x.x` introduces breaking changes to the `CustomCounter` and `CustomCounterWrapper` components.

The reasons behind those changes are the following:
The component kept an internal state, which prevented the consumers of this component from overriding the value of the counter.
This lead to a number of bugs and workarounds in production code, and was not aligned with our guidelines.

Breaking changes to the `CustomCounter` and `CustomCounterWrapper` components:

1. Remove the `isNegativeValueAllowed` prop
   Change in behaviour:
   _Given:_ I render `<CustomCounter value={-10} isNegativeValueAllowed={false}>`
   _Before:_ Component renders the `-` placeholder
   _After:_ Component renders `-10` value

2. Allow pushing new values to the rendered component from external state
   Change in behaviour:
   _Given:_ When I render `<CustomCounter value={valueFromState} onChange={setNewValueInTheState}>`
   Then I provide an init value of `1`
   And then I click `+` to increment
   Then the state of the application is updated and I see `2`
   When the state changes `valueFromState` changes to `100` due to state changes outside of the events triggered by `<CustomCounter />`
   _Before:_ Component still renders `2` and does NOT accept new state
   _After:_ Component renders `100` (the newly provided value)
